# Blizzard Legacy Game Volunteer Platform

A modern web application for recruiting C++ game software engineers to volunteer on Blizzard's legacy software, specifically StarCraft 2 and other legacy titles.

## üåä Motivation

This platform was inspired by the challenges faced by legacy Blizzard games since Microsoft's acquisition of Blizzard/Activision. As support for beloved titles like StarCraft 2 has become more difficult and expensive to maintain, we aim to create a community-driven solution.

*Watch: Discussion about the challenges facing legacy Blizzard games that inspired this platform.*

Our mission is to connect passionate, experienced game developers with the games they love, allowing them to volunteer their time and expertise to help maintain and improve these legacy titles. 

The platform's goals are:

1. Build a community of experienced C++ game developer volunteers
2. Create a formal proposal for Blizzard to establish a "Legacy Game Volunteer Platform Manager" position who will:
   - Identify, prioritize, and assign issues affecting legacy games to qualified community volunteers
   - Facilitate code reviews and integration of community contributions
3. Eventually become a formal Blizzard entity, creating a structured volunteer program similar to an internship

We recognize that this initiative may still require resources from Blizzard for management and oversight. If necessary, we're prepared to explore crowdfunding options to support these roles.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js with App Router, React, TailwindCSS, Framer Motion
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.17.0 or later
- MongoDB instance (local or Atlas)

### Environment Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://admin:adminpassword@localhost:27017/blizzard?authSource=admin
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_nextauth_secret
```

> Note: The NEXTAUTH_SECRET should be a secure random string. You can generate one with: `openssl rand -base64 32`

### Installation

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Run mongodb using docker.

We will create a folder called /blizzard

```bash
docker run --name blizzard-mongodb -p 27017:27017 -v blizzard-mongo-data:/data/db -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=admin -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=adminpassword -d mongo:latest
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the application.

### Build and Production

Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

Start the production server:

```bash
npm start
```
